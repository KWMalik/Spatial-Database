This directory contains a skeleton for CS61B Project 2.

Although some of what's in here might seem mysterious to you, try to
understand what it's all for.  Don't be afraid to ask us about it.

README                  This file.  Don't turn this in.

track.java              A skeleton for the main program.  All this does is
                        to call the real main program in the tracker.Main
                        class.

User-Manual             Description of the program for one of its users.

INTERNALS               Overview of the "guts" of your program: what's in
                        it, and what it does. Used by anyone who wants to
                        enhance or maintain your program, as opposed to
                        simply using it.

Makefile                For you Unix users: this provides some simple
                        compilation and testing support: make to compile,
                        make clean to remove reproducible files, make check
                        to compile and run Junit tests.

The util package (directory util):

  Set2D.java              The API for your set-of-particles class.  Don't
                          change.

  QuadTree.java           The skeleton for your quadtree implementation.
                          Don't add any public or protected methods 
                          or constructors.  Otherwise, change at will.

  QuadTreeNode.java       Skeleton used by QuadTree for the actual
                          tree structure.  Change or discard at will.

  Testing.java            Skeleton JUnit tests for the util package.
                          Also contains full regression tests of the 
                          main program.  Change or discard at will.

  Makefile                Refers to Makefile in outer directory.

The tracker package (directory tracker):

  Main.java               Skeleton for the real main program.  We put it in a
                          package like this to keep as little public as
                          needed.

  ProblemException.java   A useful checked exception you might want to use
                          for indicating errors.

  ExitException.java      A useful exception for signalling program exit.
                          We use this in preference to System.exit to allow
                          JUnit testing of the main program.

  Debugging.java          Utility file for managing debugging output.

  Testing.java            Skeleton for JUnit testing of the tracker package.

  Makefile                Refers to Makefile in outer directory.

The testing directory

  test0.trk, test1.trk    Input files used by tracker.Testing for testing.
                          REMINDER: These are samples only.  They DON'T
                          constitute adequate testing.

  test0.std, test1.std    Output that is supposed to result from test*.trk.
                          You may have to modify to conform to choices
                          you make in the order in which you output results
                          of some commands.
